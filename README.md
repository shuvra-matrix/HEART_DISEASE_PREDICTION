<h4> My Project aims to foresee the odds of having heart disease as probable cause of 
computerized prediction of heart disease that is helpful in the medical field for clinicians and 
patients </h4>
<br>
<h4>For this project I have collected the dataset from Kaggle. It comprises a real 
dataset of 300 examples of data with 14 various attributes (13 predictors; 1 class) like blood 
pressure, type of chest pain, electrocardiogram result, etc. IN this research, we have used 
four algorithms to get reasons for heart disease and create a model with the maximum 
possible accuracy.

<h4>In This project using KNN algorithm to predict the accuracy where K=4 then I got 
about 85.71% accuracy. And it is highest from other algorithem what i got </h4>
<br>
<h4>Now i use this trained model in django to make a functional web app for user . Where user can check there result by providing there required health related data . </h4>
<h4> Here i use joblib to save my machine leariing model </h4>
<h4> Joblib is part of the SciPy ecosystem and provides utilities for pipelining Python jobs.It provides utilities for saving and loading Python objects that make use of NumPy data structures, efficiently.This can be useful for some machine learning algorithms that require a lot of parameters or store the entire dataset (like K-Nearest Neighbors). </h4>

<h4>As you can see in this image , you need to fill up those fields with patients data . After submit this you can see test report Negative or Positive </h4>
