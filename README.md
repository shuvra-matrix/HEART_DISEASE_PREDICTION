<h4> My Project aims to foresee the odds of having heart disease as probable cause of 
computerized prediction of heart disease that is helpful in the medical field for clinicians and 
patients </h4>
<br>
<h4>For this project I have collected the dataset from Kaggle. It comprises a real 
dataset of 300 examples of data with 14 various attributes (13 predictors; 1 class) like blood 
pressure, type of chest pain, electrocardiogram result, etc. IN this research, we have used 
four algorithms to get reasons for heart disease and create a model with the maximum 
possible accuracy.

<h4>In This project using KNN algorithm to predict the accuracy where K=4 then I got 
about 85.71% accuracy. And it is highest from other algorithem what i got </h4>
