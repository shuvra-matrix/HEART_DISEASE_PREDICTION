    <h2> Heart disease:</h2>
    <p>In comparison to the brain, which is the most important organ in the human body, the heart is the next most important organ. It circulates blood and supplies all of the body's organs. Heart disease ailments are the most common of all diseases.The term “heart disease” refers to several types of heart conditions. The most common type of heart disease in the United States is coronary artery disease (CAD), which affects the blood flow to the heart. Decreased blood flow can cause a heart attack.</p>
    <h2>What are the symptoms of heart disease?</h2>
    <p>Heart disease can sometimes be "silent," with no indications or symptoms until a person has a heart attack, heart failure, or an arrhythmia. Symptoms that occur as a result of these events include</p>
