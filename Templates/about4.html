<h2>HEART DISEASE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING</h2>
<br>
<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<br>
<p>In comparison to the brain, which is the most important organ in the human body, the heart is the 
next most important organ. It circulates blood and supplies all of the body's organs. Heart disease 
ailments are the most common of all diseases. Medical experts undertake various reviews on 
heart diseases and compile information on heart patients, their symptoms, and disease 
development. Many harmful habits, such as excessive cholesterol, obesity, increased triglyceride 
levels, hypertension, and so on, raise the risk of heart disease. People in this fast-paced world 
want to live a very luxurious life, so they work like machines in order to earn a lot of money and 
live a comfortable life. As a result, they forget to look after themselves, and their food habits and 
lifestyles change as a result. They are more tense, have high blood pressure and sugar levels at a 
young age, and they don't give themselves enough rest and eat whatever they get.</p>

<h3>OBJECTIVES</h3>
<br>
<p>Objective of this project is to predict heart disease using machine learning. Also developed a web 
application for users using this machine learning model to predict heart disease.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>DATA SOURCE</h3>
<br>
<p>For heart disease prediction 1.0 I have collected the dataset from Kaggle. In this dataset there are 300 examples 
of data with 14 various attributes like age, Cholesterol, type of chest pain, electrocardiogram 
result, etc. In this research, we have used four algorithms to get reasons for heart disease and 
create a model with the maximum possible accuracy. Data like</p>
<br>
<p>For prediction 2.0 i use The cardiovascular disease dataset is an open-source dataset found on Kaggle. The data consists of 70,000 patient records (34,979 presenting with cardiovascular disease and 35,021 not presenting with cardiovascular disease) and contains 11 features (4 demographic, 4 examination, and 3 social history).The cardiovascular disease dataset is an open-source dataset found on Kaggle.

<br>
<h3>Used Model</h3>
<p>For prediction 1.0 i use KNN and For prediction 2.0 i use RandomForest because i got best result in this Model .</p>
