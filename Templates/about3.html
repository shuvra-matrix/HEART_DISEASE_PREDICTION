<h2>What can You do to lower my risk of heart disease?</h3>
<p>Fortunately, there are several things you may take to lower your risk of heart disease:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Control your blood pressure.</strong>Heart disease is caused by high blood pressure, which is a key risk factor. It's critical to have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis - at least once a year for most individuals, and much more frequently if you have high blood pressure. Take actions to avoid or control high blood pressure, including making lifestyle changes.</li><br/>

<li><strong>Keep your cholesterol and triglyceride levels under control.</strong> Cholesterol levels that are too high can clog arteries, increasing your risk of coronary artery disease and heart stroke. Cholesterol can be reduced through a combination of lifestyle changes and medications (if necessary). Triglycerides are a form of fat found in the bloodstream. High triglyceride levels can also increase the risk of coronary heart disease, particularly in women.</li><br/>

<li><strong>Stay at a healthy weight.</strong> Obesity or being overweight can increase your risk of heart disease. This is mostly due to their association with other heart disease risk factors such as high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, high blood pressure, and diabetes. These dangers can be reduced if you maintain a healthy weight.</li><br/>

<li><strong>Eat a healthy diet.</strong> Limit saturated fats, high-sodium diets, and added sweets. Consume a variety of fruits, veggies, and whole grains. The DASH diet is an example of an eating plan that can help you lower your blood pressure and cholesterol, two factors that can reduce your heart disease risk.</li><br/>

<li><strong>Get regular exercise.</strong> Exercise offers numerous advantages, including strengthening the heart and increasing circulation. It can also aid in the maintenance of a healthy weight as well as the reduction of cholesterol and blood pressure. All of these things can help you avoid heart disease.</li><br/>

<li><strong>Limit alcohol.</strong>Too much alcohol might cause your blood pressure to rise. It also adds more calories, potentially leading to weight gain. Both of these factors increase your chances of developing heart disease. Men should limit themselves to two alcoholic drinks each day, while women should limit themselves to one.</li><br/>

<li><strong>Don't smoke.</strong> Cigarette smoking elevates blood pressure and increases your risk of heart attack and stroke. Don't start smoking if you don't already. If you smoke, stopping reduces your chances of developing heart disease. You can get assistance from your health care professional in determining the best method for you to quit.</li><br/>

<li><strong>Manage stress.</strong> In many ways, stress is linked to heart disease. It has the potential to elevate your blood pressure. A heart attack can be triggered by extreme stress. Furthermore, certain common stress-relieving behaviours, such as overeating, heavy drinking, and smoking, are harmful to your heart. Exercising, listening to music, focusing on something calm or serene, and meditating are all good strategies to handle stress.</li><br/>

<li><strong>Manage diabetes.</strong> Diabetic heart disease is two times more likely if you have diabetes. Diabetes causes high blood sugar, which damages your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels over time. As a result, it's critical to get tested for diabetes and, if diagnosed, to keep it under control.</li><br/>

<li><strong>Make sure that you get enough sleep.</strong> You increase your chances of high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes if you don't get enough sleep. These three factors can increase your chances of developing heart disease. The average adult need 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night. Make sure you're getting enough sleep. If you're having trouble sleeping, make an appointment with your doctor. Sleep apnea is a condition that causes people to cease breathing for small periods of time while sleeping. This makes it difficult to get a decent night's sleep and increases your risk of heart disease. If you suspect you have it, speak with your doctor about getting a sleep study. Also, if you do have sleep apnea, make sure you get it treated.</li>
